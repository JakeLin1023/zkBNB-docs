## How to fund zkBNB Wallet
On the [wallet bridge page](https://test.zkbnbchain.org/wallet), you can transfer BNB from BSC to zkBNB.

## How do I register my NFT collection on zkBNB Marketplace?
On [this](https://zkbnb.bnbchain.org/market/collection/create) page on the zkBNB Marketplace website, the `/market/collection/create` can be used for any environment.

## Are there any onboarding limits?
In order to ensure the safety and security of users' funds, zkBNB has implemented a deposit cap. This deposit cap is a limit on the amount of assets that users can deposit to the system. By imposing this limit, zkBNB is able to control the inflow of assets into the system and prevent any unforeseen issues from arising that could potentially cause users to lose their funds. It is worth noting this value is configurable and will be adjusted according to the market situation.

## How do I delete my collection from zkBNB Marketplace?
You can not delete any collection.
