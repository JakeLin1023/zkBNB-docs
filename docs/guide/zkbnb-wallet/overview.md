# zkBNB Wallet

zkBNB comes with [zkBNB Wallet](https://test.zkBNBchain.org/wallet) that provides seamless integration with BNB Smart Chain (Layer 1) and zkBNB (Layer 2). 

zkWallet is targetted at enabling users to connect to zkBNB, a layer 2 rollup network on the BNB Chain. By bridging BEP 20, 721, and 1155 tokens, users can transfer both coins and NFTs to the zkBNB rollup chain, resulting in faster transaction speeds and lower fees when using applications that interact with a user's zkWallet. To check zkBNB transactions, users can access "zkTrace" on the zkWallet website, which serves as the block explorer for the zkBNB chain.

Currently, available for use on zkBNB Testnet, zkBNB Wallet can be used for bridging assets from BSC to zkBNB and vice versa.
