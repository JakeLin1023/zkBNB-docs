# Fund zkBNB Wallet with Test BNB

[zkBNB Wallet](https://test.zkBNBchain.org/wallet) provides seamless integration with BNB Smart Chain (Layer 1) and zkBNB (Layer 2). Furthermore, you can use the same wallet address for both zkBNB and the BSC chain, hence, making it more convenient for users to manage their assets.

As of now, there is no faucet available, however, you can get test BNB tokens from the [BSC Test Faucet](https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart) into your BSC account and then bridge them into zkBNB using the zkBNB Wallet web application.

In this tutorial, we provide a step-by-step guide on how to use the zkBNB wallet to bridge your assets into zkBNB.

## Pre-requisites
- [Metamask Web Extension](https://metamask.io/)

## Steps to Fund your zkBNB 

:::note
This tutorial is based on transferring BNB Tokens from BSC Testnet to zkBNB Testnet. However, the steps are same for the mainnet as well.

### Step#1: Creating a BNB Wallet and funding it with BNB Test Tokens
For this tutorial, we will be using Metamask Web Wallet. As a first step, follow [this user guide](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain) to configure your Metamask Wallet with BSC Testnet and fund it with Test BNB tokens.

### Step#2: Transfering Test BNB tokens onto zkBNB using the Bridge
In order to officially use the zkBNB chain, we need to have some BNB test tokens in our zkBNB Wallet. After acquirign some test tokens in your BSC account, it is then time to transfer these into zkBNB Wallet. For this, we'll be bridging our test BNB tokens over to zkBNB using a Bridge that connects the zkBNB chain with the BNB Smart Chain.

1. On the zkBNB Wallet homepage, click on _Connect Wallet_ button.
