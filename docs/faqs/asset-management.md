## Can assets be withdrawn from L2?
Yes

Less than 6 hours

## What is Full Exit?
Full exit is just about the user can click a button and withdraw all his assets in one go.

## What is Desert Exit?
zkBNB has implemented an "Desert Exit" mechanism to ensure that users can withdraw their assets if they believe that their transactions are censored by the system. Any priority request that expires (not processed within 7 days) can activate this mechanism. Users can withdraw their assets and NFTs to L1 by following the steps provided by the system.
