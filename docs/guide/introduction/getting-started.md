# 👨‍💻 Getting Started 

The zkBNB is an infrastructure for developers that helps them to build large scale BSC-based apps with higher throughput and much lower or even zero transaction fees.

zkBNB is built on zk-Rollup architecture. ZkBNB bundle (or "roll-up") hundreds of transactions off-chain and generates cryptographic proof. These proofs can come in the form of SNARKs (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) which can prove the validity of every single transaction in the Rollup Block.

zkBNB focuses on straightforward token operations and built-in marketplaces for Gaming and Social use cases. It serves as a scalability solution for the BNB Smart Chain by bundling multiple transactions into a single transaction, reducing costs for on-chain transactions. The Zero Knowledge proof system used in zkBNB ensures a much faster finality time of the L2 transactions, that helps improve the user experience.
